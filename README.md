A library to learn and demonstrate Functional Reactive
Programming paradigm. Mostly influenced by Bacon.js and has
lots of looking-like-cut-and-paste code from there.

Why
---

* To learn. You can only learn something if you try to do
it yourself.
* To have an educational library for demonstration. It's
much simpler than Bacon.js, offers less concepts and yet
works.
* For fun.

Howto develop
---
* *Set up*. Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
* *Run tests*. Execute `npm test`.
* *Run example*. Execute `npm run-script simple-example`.
It will run on `localhost` at port `3000`.
